Next was Labor, which received $392,354, and last was the Nationals, which received $59,991.The Greens were not included as the party has a policy of refusing donations from fossil fuel companies and received none.By far the biggest donor was Woodside Energy, which announced last year it was pushing ahead with its $16bn project to open up the Scarborough gas field, and gave $124,000 to the Coalition and $108,350 to Labor, making for a total of $232,250.The next biggest donors were the Minerals Council of Australia, which gave $193,943 ($101,192 to the Liberals, $28,091 to the Nationals and $64,660 to Labor), and the trust for \\u201ccoal baron\\u201d Trevor St Baker, which donated $165,202. Of this, $112,758 went to the Liberal party and $52,444 to Labor.In many cases, the amounts donated skewed towards the Liberal party with groups like the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea) giving the Liberal party $72,610 compared to $31,650 for Labor.\\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morningOther companies with controversial gas developments were also spending big.Santos, which is pursuing the $3.6bn Narrabri gas project, donated $44,000 to the Labor party but nothing to the Liberals. Meanwhile, Empire Energy Group, a gas company with strong links to the Coalition that is working to frack the Beetaloo Basin, gave $40,000 to the Liberal party and $25,000 to Labor.Shani Tager, the senior campaign manager at 350, said it was clear fossil fuel companies attempting to develop projects facing significant community opposition were attempting to buy political support.Anthony Pratt gave Liberals $1.3m while upstart political groups gain sizeable donationsRead more\\u201cIt\\u2019s companies that have high-profile projects that have a really strong pushback against them that are making these donations to shore up political support,\\u201d Tager said.With \\u201cmore money than ever\\u201d being donated by fossil fuel companies, Tager said political donations from the oil and gas sector should be banned over the risk it may influence policymaking in a way that stops action on climate change.\\u201cThe Morrison government has been really, vocally supportive of the gas industry and in addition to being supportive, they have really put their money where their mouth is, they give money to these groups,\\u201d Taber said.\\u201cThis money is buying what these companies want, and that is more subsidies and special conditions for their projects going ahead.\\u201dThe federal minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, and the Labor shadow ministers, Ed Husic and Chris Bowen, were contacted for comment.Last year the International Energy Agency said limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal set out in the Paris agreement, meant exploration and exploitation of new fossil fuel basins had to stop in 2021.\",\n          \"Countries should impose windfall taxes on fossil fuel companies and divert the money to vulnerable nations suffering worsening losses from the climate crisis, the United Nations secretary general has urged.Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres said that \\u201cpolluters must pay\\u201d for the escalating damage caused by heatwaves, floods, drought and other climate impacts, and demanded that it was \\u201chigh time to put fossil fuel producers, investors and enablers on notice\\u201d.\\u201cToday, I am calling on all developed economies to tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies,\\u201d Guterres said in a speech to the UN general assembly on Tuesday. \\u201cThose funds should be redirected in two ways \\u2013 to countries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis and to people struggling with rising food and energy prices.\\u201dGuterres\\u2019s appeal came in his most urgent, and bleakest, speech to date on the state of the planet, and the will of governments to change course.His first words were: \\u201cOur world is in big trouble.\\u201d\\u201cLet\\u2019s have no illusions. We are in rough seas. A winter of global discontent is on the horizon, a cost-of-living crisis is raging, trust is crumbling, inequalities are exploding and our planet is burning,\\u201d he told the assembly. \\u201cWe have a duty to act and yet we are gridlocked in colossal global dysfunction. The international community is not ready or willing to tackle the big dramatic challenges of our age.\\u201dThe lacerating speech, delivered at the UN headquarters in New York, echoes calls from activists, and the European Union, to tax major oil and gas firms currently enjoying record profits in the wake of Russia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In July, Exxon announced it had made a record quarterly profit of $17.8bn, while Chevron unveiled its own three-month record profit, of $11.6bn. BP, meanwhile, made a $8.5bn profit in the same period.Under Guterres\\u2019s proposal, revenue from the taxes would flow to predominantly developing countries suffering \\u201closs and damage\\u201d from global heating, to be invested in early warning systems, mopping up from disasters and other initiatives to build resilience. Vulnerable countries are poised to leverage the UN general assembly week to ask rich nations for a \\u201cclimate-related and justice-based\\u201d global tax to pay for loss and damage.Guterres has previously accused governments of having an \\u201caddiction\\u201d to fossil fuels and has called new investments in oil, coal and gas \\u201cmoral and economic madness\\u201d.But his speech on Tuesday was particularly pointed, delivered on the grand dais of the general assembly and following the secretary general\\u2019s recent visit to Pakistan, where floods from what he called \\u201ca monsoon on steroids\\u201d have submerged a third of the country and displaced millions of people.\\u201cOur planet is burning,\\u201d Guterres said, calling on world leaders to to end their \\u201csuicidal war against nature\\u201d.\\u201cThe climate crisis is the defining issue of our time,\\u201d he added. \\u201cIt must be the first priority of every government and multilateral organization. And yet climate action is being put on the back burner \\u2013 despite overwhelming public support around the world.\\u201d\\u201cWe have a rendezvous with climate disaster \\u2026 The hottest summers of today may be the coolest summers of tomorrow. Once-in-a-lifetime climate shocks may soon become once-a-year events. And with every climate disaster, we know that women and girls are the most affected. The climate crisis is a case study in moral and economic injustice.\\u201dGovernments must stage an \\u201cintervention\\u201d to break their addiction to fossil fuels, Guterres said, by targeting not only the extractive companies themselves but the entire infrastructure of businesses that support them.\\u201cThat includes the banks, private equity, asset managers and other financial institutions that continue to invest and underwrite carbon pollution,\\u201d said the secretary general.\\u201cAnd it includes the massive public relations machine raking in billions to shield the fossil fuel industry from scrutiny. Just as they did for the tobacco industry decades before, lobbyists and spin doctors have spewed harmful misinformation. Fossil fuel interests need to spend less time averting a PR disaster \\u2013 and more time averting a planetary one.\\u201dGuterres said it was \\u201chigh time to move beyond endless discussions\\u201d and deliver finance for vulnerable countries and for wealthy nations to double adaption funding by 2025, as they promised to do at UN climate talks in Scotland last year. A further round of talks, known as Cop27, will take place in Egypt in November, in which loss and damage is set to be a central issue.Although governments have agreed to restrain global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial times, almost all countries are lagging in their efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions quickly enough to avoid this level of heating and therefore avert catastrophic climate impacts.Emissions have already rebounded to pre-pandemic levels and an analysis this week showed there are plenty of known fossil fuel reserves in the world still left to burn \\u2013 enough to unleash 3.5tn tons of greenhouse gases, which would smash the carbon budget before we get to 1.5C seven times over.\",\n          \"Running the entire width of one floor at London\\u2019s Hayward gallery is a six-screen video which depicts, at about life size, a spruce tree swaying in the breeze in Finland. To accommodate its scale, the tree is projected horizontally, and at its foot stands the artist Eija-Liisa Ahtila, in a blue parka, dwarfed by the spreading conifer. The six projected sections of the tree tremble and sway out of sync with one another, adding to a growing sense of majestic befuddlement. You can\\u2019t take it in all at once, any more than you could if you stood before the real thing. Distantly, I hear the branches soughing and faint birdsong. Titled Horizontal \\u2013 Vaakasuora, it makes you look and look some more.Horizontal \\u2013 Vaakasuora is one of the highlights of Among the Trees, an exhibition that fills the Hayward with a knotty tangle of romanticism, wood carving and trunk splitting, fake trees and real trees, doomed trees and casts of trees, dead trees, trees that never lived and trees that have survived for thousands of years. Pascale Marthine Tayou\\u2019s tree bears a blossom of colourful plastic bags which rustle in the draft from the gallery\\u2019s air conditioning, while Simryn Gill\\u2019s photographs of mangroves in the Straits of Malacca focus on the plastic detritus, lost fishing gear and clothing that festoon the branches in a horrible bunting on the edge of one of the world\\u2019s busiest shipping lanes.A blossom of bags \\u2026 Pascale Marthine Tayou\\u2019s Plastic Tree B. Photograph: Oak Taylor-Smith/Courtesy of the artist and Hayward galleyThere are images of trees growing in vacant lots, of trees left standing alone as the habitat around them has been replaced by car parks, front yards and tended lawns, in a series of photographs by Robert Adams; a tree as pale and angular and bleached as the concrete wall behind it and the sky above in a painting by Gillian Carnegie; Zoe Leonard\\u2019s photographs of beleaguered New York trees growing around and through the fences and palings that contain them. All these trees, surviving against the odds.Pink blossom erupts from a straggly one before a fenced-off wasteland on a dank roadside, evoking perfectly what passes for nature in the weary edge-of-town feral hinterlands that George Shaw is so great at evoking. He captures the sense of futility and frittered time in territories marked by a blaze on a trunk, beer cans among the trodden-down leaf litter. Shaw paints the sort of non-places where people can find their pleasures or get up to no good on the margins of things. As ever, there\\u2019s no one about in his paintings, which adds to their sense of malaise. Apart from Ahtila beneath her giant spruce, there is no visible human presence in Among the Trees. But we are there, nonetheless, both as witnesses and inexorably fucking everything up. Here\\u2019s a lynching tree, photographed by Steve McQueen during the shoot for 12 Years a Slave, glowing in a lightbox. It is just a tree, venerable, old, tainted.Abel Rodr\\u00edgues and his son Wilson, from the Colombian Nonuya indigenous group, make beautiful coloured drawings evoking the Amazon forest and their knowledge of its flora and fauna, which they left for Bogot\\u00e1 in 2002. Here is one moment in the show where a sense of nature\\u2019s passing, the interconnectedness of its living landscapes, is seen with such directness and evident, deep knowledge, that it touches the heart.Among the Trees is a forest of signs. Even the gallery\\u2019s beautifully brutalist concrete walls bear the whorls and grain of the wood that was used to shutter and cast its sections. Perhaps this last provided the unconscious inspiration behind this often pleasurable and finally frustrating show of downed trunks, trees sliced into sections and reassembled, photographs of trees inverted (as though seen in a camera obscura) by Vancouver artist Rodney Graham, trees buried upside down by Robert Smithson, delicate watercolours of trees and trees only visible from certain angles, a tree carved from a log (one of several works by Giuseppe Penone), and a dense patch of forest cut by Eva Jospin from layers of corrugated cardboard. Amid this wintry tangle of trunks, branches and twigs, remnants of overgrown ruins peek from the gloom. Jospin\\u2019s work has the scale, and something of the majesty, of an arboreal rood screen. Nearby, another tangle of branches obscures Peter Doig\\u2019s 1991 The Architects Home in the Ravine, the house half hidden through frosted twigs. The quantity of accumulated details, painted touches and blips and the wandering skein of lines suck you in. I feel like a stalker in the woods, making my silent approach as I prepare a home invasion.Evoking the Amazon \\u2026 Terraza Alta II by Abel Rodr\\u00edguez. Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Hayward galleyThe theatrical atmosphere in the Hayward\\u2019s first, double-height lower gallery is accentuated by having all the works spotlit in the semi-gloom. I am not sure this entirely works for the paintings and photographs here. Thomas Struth\\u2019s mossy rocks and fallen branches below spring foliage in Japan, and his overgrown, primeval Chinese woodland \\u2013 with, disconcertingly, cable cars floating overhead \\u2013 have enough mystery and specific, well-captured light on their own.What a puzzling exhibition Among the Trees is. Given how immediate the climate emergency is, and how little explicitly records the vast losses that both environmental changes and human greed/stupidity continue to wreak on the natural world \\u2013 which is the sole thing that might save us \\u2013 will we be left with only 3D printed trees and virtual forests? Jennifer Steinkamp\\u2019s Blind Eye is another wall-length projection, filled with a grove of animated birch trees. A breeze ruffles the branches, leaves sprout, catkins grow and fall, the foliage slowly changes colour and drops in an autumn wind. The seamless cycle, a whole year compressed into three minutes, begins again.A year in three minutes \\u2026 Jennifer Steinkamp\\u2019s Blind Eye. Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Hayward galleyAt the end we come to Roxy Paine\\u2019s desolated, burned-down forest floor, a tabletop diorama whose blackened fibreglass stumps and fallen branches glow with an inner fire of carefully contrived red LED lights. Sadly this won\\u2019t do. It just feels like an arty revelling in destruction. I think of the novelty two-bar electric fire my parents had - in an antique-effect aluminium grate several Disney-ish fibreglass logs glowed, fitfully, from the orange lightbulbs and twirling pinwheels that hid beneath the grey and brown loglettes, affecting a thoroughly implausible simulacrum of the real log fire that had previously sputtered and crackled in the same fireplace. The exposed electric elements did more than destroy the illusion; heating the fibreglass, they caused it to emit a noxious tang of polyester resin. Perhaps a real fire might have been even more ecologically unfriendly, but I doubt it.

Next was Labor, which received $392,354, and last was the Nationals, which received $59,991.The Greens were not included as the party has a policy of refusing donations from fossil fuel companies and received none.By far the biggest donor was Woodside Energy, which announced last year it was pushing ahead with its $16bn project to open up the Scarborough gas field, and gave $124,000 to the Coalition and $108,350 to Labor, making for a total of $232,250.The next biggest donors were the Minerals Council of Australia, which gave $193,943 ($101,192 to the Liberals, $28,091 to the Nationals and $64,660 to Labor), and the trust for \\u201ccoal baron\\u201d Trevor St Baker, which donated $165,202. Of this, $112,758 went to the Liberal party and $52,444 to Labor.In many cases, the amounts donated skewed towards the Liberal party with groups like the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (Appea) giving the Liberal party $72,610 compared to $31,650 for Labor.\\nSign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning\\nSign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morningOther companies with controversial gas developments were also spending big.Santos, which is pursuing the $3.6bn Narrabri gas project, donated $44,000 to the Labor party but nothing to the Liberals. Meanwhile, Empire Energy Group, a gas company with strong links to the Coalition that is working to frack the Beetaloo Basin, gave $40,000 to the Liberal party and $25,000 to Labor.Shani Tager, the senior campaign manager at 350, said it was clear fossil fuel companies attempting to develop projects facing significant community opposition were attempting to buy political support.Anthony Pratt gave Liberals $1.3m while upstart political groups gain sizeable donationsRead more\\u201cIt\\u2019s companies that have high-profile projects that have a really strong pushback against them that are making these donations to shore up political support,\\u201d Tager said.With \\u201cmore money than ever\\u201d being donated by fossil fuel companies, Tager said political donations from the oil and gas sector should be banned over the risk it may influence policymaking in a way that stops action on climate change.\\u201cThe Morrison government has been really, vocally supportive of the gas industry and in addition to being supportive, they have really put their money where their mouth is, they give money to these groups,\\u201d Taber said.\\u201cThis money is buying what these companies want, and that is more subsidies and special conditions for their projects going ahead.\\u201dThe federal minister for emissions reduction, Angus Taylor, and the Labor shadow ministers, Ed Husic and Chris Bowen, were contacted for comment.Last year the International Energy Agency said limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal set out in the Paris agreement, meant exploration and exploitation of new fossil fuel basins had to stop in 2021.\",\n          \"Countries should impose windfall taxes on fossil fuel companies and divert the money to vulnerable nations suffering worsening losses from the climate crisis, the United Nations secretary general has urged.Ant\\u00f3nio Guterres said that \\u201cpolluters must pay\\u201d for the escalating damage caused by heatwaves, floods, drought and other climate impacts, and demanded that it was \\u201chigh time to put fossil fuel producers, investors and enablers on notice\\u201d.\\u201cToday, I am calling on all developed economies to tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies,\\u201d Guterres said in a speech to the UN general assembly on Tuesday. \\u201cThose funds should be redirected in two ways \\u2013 to countries suffering loss and damage caused by the climate crisis and to people struggling with rising food and energy prices.\\u201dGuterres\\u2019s appeal came in his most urgent, and bleakest, speech to date on the state of the planet, and the will of governments to change course.His first words were: \\u201cOur world is in big trouble.\\u201d\\u201cLet\\u2019s have no illusions. We are in rough seas. A winter of global discontent is on the horizon, a cost-of-living crisis is raging, trust is crumbling, inequalities are exploding and our planet is burning,\\u201d he told the assembly. \\u201cWe have a duty to act and yet we are gridlocked in colossal global dysfunction. The international community is not ready or willing to tackle the big dramatic challenges of our age.\\u201dThe lacerating speech, delivered at the UN headquarters in New York, echoes calls from activists, and the European Union, to tax major oil and gas firms currently enjoying record profits in the wake of Russia\\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. In July, Exxon announced it had made a record quarterly profit of $17.8bn, while Chevron unveiled its own three-month record profit, of $11.6bn. BP, meanwhile, made a $8.5bn profit in the same period.Under Guterres\\u2019s proposal, revenue from the taxes would flow to predominantly developing countries suffering \\u201closs and damage\\u201d from global heating, to be invested in early warning systems, mopping up from disasters and other initiatives to build resilience. Vulnerable countries are poised to leverage the UN general assembly week to ask rich nations for a \\u201cclimate-related and justice-based\\u201d global tax to pay for loss and damage.Guterres has previously accused governments of having an \\u201caddiction\\u201d to fossil fuels and has called new investments in oil, coal and gas \\u201cmoral and economic madness\\u201d.But his speech on Tuesday was particularly pointed, delivered on the grand dais of the general assembly and following the secretary general\\u2019s recent visit to Pakistan, where floods from what he called \\u201ca monsoon on steroids\\u201d have submerged a third of the country and displaced millions of people.\\u201cOur planet is burning,\\u201d Guterres said, calling on world leaders to to end their \\u201csuicidal war against nature\\u201d.\\u201cThe climate crisis is the defining issue of our time,\\u201d he added. \\u201cIt must be the first priority of every government and multilateral organization. And yet climate action is being put on the back burner \\u2013 despite overwhelming public support around the world.\\u201d\\u201cWe have a rendezvous with climate disaster \\u2026 The hottest summers of today may be the coolest summers of tomorrow. Once-in-a-lifetime climate shocks may soon become once-a-year events. And with every climate disaster, we know that women and girls are the most affected. The climate crisis is a case study in moral and economic injustice.\\u201dGovernments must stage an \\u201cintervention\\u201d to break their addiction to fossil fuels, Guterres said, by targeting not only the extractive companies themselves but the entire infrastructure of businesses that support them.\\u201cThat includes the banks, private equity, asset managers and other financial institutions that continue to invest and underwrite carbon pollution,\\u201d said the secretary general.\\u201cAnd it includes the massive public relations machine raking in billions to shield the fossil fuel industry from scrutiny. Just as they did for the tobacco industry decades before, lobbyists and spin doctors have spewed harmful misinformation. Fossil fuel interests need to spend less time averting a PR disaster \\u2013 and more time averting a planetary one.\\u201dGuterres said it was \\u201chigh time to move beyond endless discussions\\u201d and deliver finance for vulnerable countries and for wealthy nations to double adaption funding by 2025, as they promised to do at UN climate talks in Scotland last year. A further round of talks, known as Cop27, will take place in Egypt in November, in which loss and damage is set to be a central issue.Although governments have agreed to restrain global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial times, almost all countries are lagging in their efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions quickly enough to avoid this level of heating and therefore avert catastrophic climate impacts.Emissions have already rebounded to pre-pandemic levels and an analysis this week showed there are plenty of known fossil fuel reserves in the world still left to burn \\u2013 enough to unleash 3.5tn tons of greenhouse gases, which would smash the carbon budget before we get to 1.5C seven times over.\",\n          \"Running the entire width of one floor at London\\u2019s Hayward gallery is a six-screen video which depicts, at about life size, a spruce tree swaying in the breeze in Finland. To accommodate its scale, the tree is projected horizontally, and at its foot stands the artist Eija-Liisa Ahtila, in a blue parka, dwarfed by the spreading conifer. The six projected sections of the tree tremble and sway out of sync with one another, adding to a growing sense of majestic befuddlement. You can\\u2019t take it in all at once, any more than you could if you stood before the real thing. Distantly, I hear the branches soughing and faint birdsong. Titled Horizontal \\u2013 Vaakasuora, it makes you look and look some more.Horizontal \\u2013 Vaakasuora is one of the highlights of Among the Trees, an exhibition that fills the Hayward with a knotty tangle of romanticism, wood carving and trunk splitting, fake trees and real trees, doomed trees and casts of trees, dead trees, trees that never lived and trees that have survived for thousands of years.

Photograph: Oak Taylor-Smith/Courtesy of the artist and Hayward galleyThere are images of trees growing in vacant lots, of trees left standing alone as the habitat around them has been replaced by car parks, front yards and tended lawns, in a series of photographs by Robert Adams; a tree as pale and angular and bleached as the concrete wall behind it and the sky above in a painting by Gillian Carnegie; Zoe Leonard\\u2019s photographs of beleaguered New York trees growing around and through the fences and palings that contain them. All these trees, surviving against the odds.Pink blossom erupts from a straggly one before a fenced-off wasteland on a dank roadside, evoking perfectly what passes for nature in the weary edge-of-town feral hinterlands that George Shaw is so great at evoking. He captures the sense of futility and frittered time in territories marked by a blaze on a trunk, beer cans among the trodden-down leaf litter. Shaw paints the sort of non-places where people can find their pleasures or get up to no good on the margins of things. As ever, there\\u2019s no one about in his paintings, which adds to their sense of malaise. Apart from Ahtila beneath her giant spruce, there is no visible human presence in Among the Trees. But we are there, nonetheless, both as witnesses and inexorably fucking everything up. Here\\u2019s a lynching tree, photographed by Steve McQueen during the shoot for 12 Years a Slave, glowing in a lightbox. It is just a tree, venerable, old, tainted.Abel Rodr\\u00edgues and his son Wilson, from the Colombian Nonuya indigenous group, make beautiful coloured drawings evoking the Amazon forest and their knowledge of its flora and fauna, which they left for Bogot\\u00e1 in 2002. Here is one moment in the show where a sense of nature\\u2019s passing, the interconnectedness of its living landscapes, is seen with such directness and evident, deep knowledge, that it touches the heart.Among the Trees is a forest of signs. Even the gallery\\u2019s beautifully brutalist concrete walls bear the whorls and grain of the wood that was used to shutter and cast its sections. Perhaps this last provided the unconscious inspiration behind this often pleasurable and finally frustrating show of downed trunks, trees sliced into sections and reassembled, photographs of trees inverted (as though seen in a camera obscura) by Vancouver artist Rodney Graham, trees buried upside down by Robert Smithson, delicate watercolours of trees and trees only visible from certain angles, a tree carved from a log (one of several works by Giuseppe Penone), and a dense patch of forest cut by Eva Jospin from layers of corrugated cardboard. Amid this wintry tangle of trunks, branches and twigs, remnants of overgrown ruins peek from the gloom. Jospin\\u2019s work has the scale, and something of the majesty, of an arboreal rood screen. Nearby, another tangle of branches obscures Peter Doig\\u2019s 1991 The Architects Home in the Ravine, the house half hidden through frosted twigs. The quantity of accumulated details, painted touches and blips and the wandering skein of lines suck you in. I feel like a stalker in the woods, making my silent approach as I prepare a home invasion.Evoking the Amazon \\u2026 Terraza Alta II by Abel Rodr\\u00edguez. Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Hayward galleyThe theatrical atmosphere in the Hayward\\u2019s first, double-height lower gallery is accentuated by having all the works spotlit in the semi-gloom. I am not sure this entirely works for the paintings and photographs here. Thomas Struth\\u2019s mossy rocks and fallen branches below spring foliage in Japan, and his overgrown, primeval Chinese woodland \\u2013 with, disconcertingly, cable cars floating overhead \\u2013 have enough mystery and specific, well-captured light on their own.What a puzzling exhibition Among the Trees is. Given how immediate the climate emergency is, and how little explicitly records the vast losses that both environmental changes and human greed/stupidity continue to wreak on the natural world \\u2013 which is the sole thing that might save us \\u2013 will we be left with only 3D printed trees and virtual forests? Jennifer Steinkamp\\u2019s Blind Eye is another wall-length projection, filled with a grove of animated birch trees. A breeze ruffles the branches, leaves sprout, catkins grow and fall, the foliage slowly changes colour and drops in an autumn wind. The seamless cycle, a whole year compressed into three minutes, begins again.A year in three minutes \\u2026 Jennifer Steinkamp\\u2019s Blind Eye. Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Hayward galleyAt the end we come to Roxy Paine\\u2019s desolated, burned-down forest floor, a tabletop diorama whose blackened fibreglass stumps and fallen branches glow with an inner fire of carefully contrived red LED lights. Sadly this won\\u2019t do. It just feels like an arty revelling in destruction. I think of the novelty two-bar electric fire my parents had - in an antique-effect aluminium grate several Disney-ish fibreglass logs glowed, fitfully, from the orange lightbulbs and twirling pinwheels that hid beneath the grey and brown loglettes, affecting a thoroughly implausible simulacrum of the real log fire that had previously sputtered and crackled in the same fireplace. The exposed electric elements did more than destroy the illusion; heating the fibreglass, they caused it to emit a noxious tang of polyester resin. Perhaps a real fire might have been even more ecologically unfriendly, but I doubt it.

This humble little moss makes up the bulk of our peat bogs and holds up to 20 times its weight in water. That makes boglands huge sponges that store water, slowing its flow and helping prevent flooding downstream.In fact, sphagnum is so absorbent it was used as a medical dressing for wounds in the first world war. And when sphagnum turns into peat over thousands of years it locks away vast amounts of carbon, at least a third of all the carbon on land.But much of our peatland has been drained, degraded and dried out. The moorland fires in last summer\\u2019s drought caught ablaze at terrifying speed and Saddleworth Moor outside Manchester was ablaze for three weeks, leaving plants scorched and releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases \\u2013 and the fires are still smouldering underground, possibly for years, even when it rains.Peatlands are being restored in places, such as the Peak District, where the Moors for the Future Partnership is blocking drainage channels to hold more water on the moors, and then inoculated with plugs of sphagnum embedded in gel, or pellets of the moss spores sprayed onto the ground. But there is no one magic bullet to restoring peatlands and various strategies are being tried out.\\u00a0The image on this article was changed on 17 January 2019. The original picture was of Polytrichum, or haircap moss, rather than sphagnum.\",\n          \"Stressed youngsters might well enjoy a less commercial society, writes Clare Hobba.

As a teenager, instead of buying new, I embraced the 1970s revival of handicrafts and made my own leather bags, floaty skirts and bead jewellery. Cars were a rarity and I travelled by bus, bike or on foot and got to know my neighbours.Reducing our carbon footprint could take us back to the 1970s. But would that be completely bad? Today\\u2019s stressed youngsters might well enjoy the benefits of a less commercial society. After the anger, there may be space for a better way of life.Clare HobbaSt Albans Commentary on the Met Gala (Fab-u-lous! The campest Met Gala ever, G2, 8 May), fashion\\u2019s most exclusive evening, touched upon all but one aspect of the event: environmental impact. The fashion industry is a major contributor to climate change; its carbon footprint exceeds that of international flights and maritime shipping combined. The UK government\\u2019s recent report on fast fashion makes a fitting and appalling comparison to the carbon footprint of all EU member states (3.5bn tonnes). The dyeing, finishing and washing of clothes also generates excessive water waste.The crisis in materials as well as changing consumer sentiment makes me question the role of renowned events such as the Met Gala in curbing climate change. The pinnacle of slow fashion \\u2013 wherein ideas typically take nine months to materialise into a single product \\u2013 may seem an odd method for changing the throwaway culture of fast fashion. However, the Met Gala\\u2019s role in fostering creativity to heights generally considered extravagant should be seen as the ideal platform for innovation. Competing ideas for how to green glamour at the level of high fashion, which can more readily assume risk, would pave the way for the gradual adoption of more sustainable methods by the wider fashion industry. The 2019 Met Gala carpet was pink.

We\\u2019re planting a global forest to offset Trump\\u2019s monumental stupidity.\\u201dThe project was launched last March and in less than a year over a million trees have been pledged from people around the world, but particularly in the US and Europe.The donated trees are to go towards offsetting the 650m tonnes of CO2 that will be released into the atmosphere by 2025 if the president\\u2019s plans to backtrack on US climate commitments go ahead, organisers say.The figure of 650m tonnes \\u2013 equivalent to the annual carbon footprint of 33 million Americans \\u2013 is calculated from Trump\\u2019s decision to roll back the US 2015 Paris agreement pledge to lower emissions by at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2025.It would take 10bn trees \\u2013 covering a landmass roughly the size of the state of Kentucky \\u2013 to offset the full amount.\\u201cWe\\u2019re really pleased at how quickly it happened,\\u201d co-founder Adrien Taylor told Newshub. Should we give up half of the Earth to wildlife?Read more\\u201cWe\\u2019re just pleased to see we\\u2019re not the only people in the world who care about climate change, because sometimes it can feel like that.\\u201dThe project\\u2019s co-founder, British climate scientist Dr Dan Price, said: \\u201cIn 30 years from now, when people look back on the Trump presidency as an attack on the planet and on rational thought, it would be pretty cool if the history books say his actions were negligible because the global community offset the administration\\u2019s additional emissions.\\u201cIt\\u2019s clearly a big challenge, but only recently the world record was broken when India put 66m trees in the ground in a day. If we all chip in, it is a completely realistic goal.\\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This humble little moss makes up the bulk of our peat bogs and holds up to 20 times its weight in water. That makes boglands huge sponges that store water, slowing its flow and helping prevent flooding downstream.In fact, sphagnum is so absorbent it was used as a medical dressing for wounds in the first world war. And when sphagnum turns into peat over thousands of years it locks away vast amounts of carbon, at least a third of all the carbon on land.But much of our peatland has been drained, degraded and dried out. The moorland fires in last summer\\u2019s drought caught ablaze at terrifying speed and Saddleworth Moor outside Manchester was ablaze for three weeks, leaving plants scorched and releasing vast amounts of greenhouse gases \\u2013 and the fires are still smouldering underground, possibly for years, even when it rains.Peatlands are being restored in places, such as the Peak District, where the Moors for the Future Partnership is blocking drainage channels to hold more water on the moors, and then inoculated with plugs of sphagnum embedded in gel, or pellets of the moss spores sprayed onto the ground. But there is no one magic bullet to restoring peatlands and various strategies are being tried out.\\u00a0The image on this article was changed on 17 January 2019. The original picture was of Polytrichum, or haircap moss, rather than sphagnum.\",\n          \"Stressed youngsters might well enjoy a less commercial society, writes Clare Hobba.

But today\\u2019s children are not the first generation to have a sharp awakening to our violation of the environment \\u2013 pollution was a major concern for youngsters of the 1970s.As a child, my cultural heroes were environmentalists. The Wombles recycled rubbish, singing: \\u201cPick up the pieces and make them into something new / Is what we do.\\u201d Bagpuss was an expert in thrift: \\u201cWe will fix it like new, new, new,\\u201d sang the mice. As a teenager, instead of buying new, I embraced the 1970s revival of handicrafts and made my own leather bags, floaty skirts and bead jewellery. Cars were a rarity and I travelled by bus, bike or on foot and got to know my neighbours.Reducing our carbon footprint could take us back to the 1970s. But would that be completely bad? Today\\u2019s stressed youngsters might well enjoy the benefits of a less commercial society. After the anger, there may be space for a better way of life.Clare HobbaSt Albans Commentary on the Met Gala (Fab-u-lous! The campest Met Gala ever, G2, 8 May), fashion\\u2019s most exclusive evening, touched upon all but one aspect of the event: environmental impact. The fashion industry is a major contributor to climate change; its carbon footprint exceeds that of international flights and maritime shipping combined. The UK government\\u2019s recent report on fast fashion makes a fitting and appalling comparison to the carbon footprint of all EU member states (3.5bn tonnes). The dyeing, finishing and washing of clothes also generates excessive water waste.The crisis in materials as well as changing consumer sentiment makes me question the role of renowned events such as the Met Gala in curbing climate change. The pinnacle of slow fashion \\u2013 wherein ideas typically take nine months to materialise into a single product \\u2013 may seem an odd method for changing the throwaway culture of fast fashion. However, the Met Gala\\u2019s role in fostering creativity to heights generally considered extravagant should be seen as the ideal platform for innovation. Competing ideas for how to green glamour at the level of high fashion, which can more readily assume risk, would pave the way for the gradual adoption of more sustainable methods by the wider fashion industry. The 2019 Met Gala carpet was pink.
